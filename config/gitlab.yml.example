# GitLab application config file  #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# How to use:
# 1. Copy file as gitlab.yml
# 2. Update gitlab -> host with your fully qualified domain name
# 3. Update gitlab -> email_from
# 4. If you installed Git from source, change git -> bin_path to /usr/local/bin/git
#    IMPORTANT: If Git was installed in a different location use that instead.
#    You can check with `which git`. If a wrong path of Git is specified, it will
#     result in various issues such as failures of GitLab CI builds.
# 5. Review this configuration file for other settings you may want to adjust

  # 1. GitLab app settings
  # ==========================

  ## GitLab settings
  gitlab:
    ## Web server settings (note: host is the FQDN, do not include http://)
    host: localhost
    port: 80 # Set to 443 if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details
    https: false # Set to true if using HTTPS, see installation.md#using-https for additional HTTPS configuration details

    # Uncomment this line below if your ssh host is different from HTTP/HTTPS one
    # (you'd obviously need to replace ssh.host_example.com with your own host).
    # Otherwise, ssh host will be set to the `host:` value above
    # ssh_host: ssh.host_example.com

    # Relative URL support
    # WARNING: We recommend using an FQDN to host GitLab in a root path instead
    # of using a relative URL.
    # Documentation: http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
    # Uncomment and customize the following line to run in a non-root path
    #
    # relative_url_root: /gitlab

    # Trusted Proxies
    # Customize if you have GitLab behind a reverse proxy which is running on a different machine.
    # Add the IP address for your reverse proxy to the list, otherwise users will appear signed in from that address.
    trusted_proxies:
      # Examples:
      #- 192.168.1.0/24
      #- 192.168.2.1
      #- 2001:0db8::/32

    # Uncomment and customize if you can't use the default user to run GitLab (default: 'git')
    # user: git

    ## Date & Time settings
    # Uncomment and customize if you want to change the default time zone of GitLab application.
    # To see all available zones, run `bundle exec rake time:zones:all RAILS_ENV=production`
    # time_zone: 'UTC'

    ## Email settings
    # Uncomment and set to false if you need to disable email sending from GitLab (default: true)
    # email_enabled: true
    # Email address used in the "From" field in mails sent by GitLab
    email_from: example@example.com
    email_display_name: GitLab
    email_reply_to: noreply@example.com
    email_subject_suffix: ''

    # Email server smtp settings are in config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb.sample

    # default_can_create_group: false  # default: true
    # username_changing_enabled: false # default: true - User can change her username/namespace
    ## Default theme ID
    ##   1 - Indigo
    ##   2 - Dark
    ##   3 - Light
    ##   4 - Blue
    ##   5 - Green
    ##   6 - Light Indigo
    ##   7 - Light Blue
    ##   8 - Light Green
    ##   9 - Red
    ##   10 - Light Red
    # default_theme: 1 # default: 1

    ## Automatic issue closing
    # If a commit message matches this regular expression, all issues referenced from the matched text will be closed.
    # This happens when the commit is pushed or merged into the default branch of a project.
    # When not specified the default issue_closing_pattern as specified below will be used.
    # Tip: you can test your closing pattern at http://rubular.com.
    # issue_closing_pattern: '\b((?:[Cc]los(?:e[sd]?|ing)|\b[Ff]ix(?:e[sd]|ing)?|\b[Rr]esolv(?:e[sd]?|ing)|\b[Ii]mplement(?:s|ed|ing)?)(:?) +(?:(?:issues? +)?%{issue_ref}(?:(?:, *| +and +)?)|([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+-\d+))+)'

  # ==========================

  ## LDAP settings
  # You can test connections and inspect a sample of the LDAP users with login
  # access by running:

  ldap:
    enabled: false
    servers:
      ##########################################################################
      #
      # Since GitLab 7.4, LDAP servers get ID's (below the ID is 'main'). GitLab
      # Enterprise Edition now supports connecting to multiple LDAP servers.
      #
      # If you are updating from the old (pre-7.4) syntax, you MUST give your
      # old server the ID 'main'.
      #
      ##########################################################################
      main: # 'main' is the GitLab 'provider ID' of this LDAP server
        ## label
        #
        # A human-friendly name for your LDAP server. It is OK to change the label later,
        # for instance if you find out it is too large to fit on the web page.
        #
        # Example: 'Paris' or 'Acme, Ltd.'
        label: 'LDAP'

        # Example: 'ldap.mydomain.com'
        host: '_your_ldap_server'
        # This port is an example, it is sometimes different but it is always an integer and not a string
        port: 389 # usually 636 for SSL
        uid: 'uid' # This should be the attribute, not the value that maps to uid.

        password: '_the_password_of_the_bind_user'

        # Encryption method. The "method" key is deprecated in favor of
        # "encryption".
        #
        #   Examples: "start_tls" or "simple_tls" or "plain"
        #
        #   Deprecated values: "tls" was replaced with "start_tls" and "ssl" was
        #   replaced with "simple_tls".
        #
        encryption: 'plain'

        # Enables SSL certificate verification if encryption method is
        # "start_tls" or "simple_tls". Defaults to true.
        verify_certificates: true

        # Specifies the path to a file containing a PEM-format CA certificate,
        # e.g. if you need to use an internal CA.
        #
        #   Example: '/etc/ca.pem'
        #
        ca_cert: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'

        # Specifies the SSL version for OpenSSL to use, if the OpenSSL default
        # is not appropriate.

        #   Example: 'TLSv1_1'
        #
        ssl_version: ''

        # Set a timeout, in seconds, for LDAP queries. This helps avoid blocking
        # a request if the LDAP server becomes unresponsive.
        # A value of 0 means there is no timeout.
        timeout: 10

        # This setting specifies if LDAP server is Active Directory LDAP server.

        # If allow_username_or_email_login is enabled, GitLab will ignore everything
        # after the first '@' in the LDAP username submitted by the user on login.
        #
        # Example:
        # - the user enters 'jane.doe@example.com' and 'p@ssw0rd' as LDAP credentials;
        # - GitLab queries the LDAP server with 'jane.doe' and 'p@ssw0rd'.
        #
        # If you are using "uid: 'userPrincipalName'" on ActiveDirectory you need to
        # disable this setting, because the userPrincipalName contains an '@'.

        #   Format: RFC 4515 https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4515
        #   Ex. (employeeType=developer)
        #
        #   Note: GitLab does not support omniauth-ldap's custom filter syntax.
        #
        #   Example for getting only specific users:
        #   '(&(objectclass=user)(|(samaccountname=momo)(samaccountname=toto)))'
        #
        user_filter: ''

        # LDAP attributes that GitLab will use to create an account for the LDAP user.
        # The specified attribute can either be the attribute name as a string (e.g. 'mail'),
        # or an array of attribute names to try in order (e.g. ['mail', 'email']).
        # Note that the user's LDAP login will always be the attribute specified as `uid` above.
        attributes:
          # The username will be used in paths for the user's own projects
          # (like `gitlab.example.com/username/project`) and when mentioning
          # them in issues, merge request and comments (like `@username`).

  # 4. Advanced settings
  # ==========================

  ## Repositories settings
  repositories:
    # Paths where repositories can be stored. Give the canonicalized absolute pathname.
    # IMPORTANT: None of the path components may be symlink, because
    # gitlab-shell invokes Dir.pwd inside the repository path and that results
    # real path not the symlink.
    storages: # You must have at least a `default` storage path.
      default:

        gitaly_address: unix:/run/gitlab/gitaly.socket  # TCP connections are supported too (e.g. tcp://host:port). TLS connections are also supported using the system certificate pool (eg: tls://host:port).
        # gitaly_token: 'special token' # Optional: override global gitaly.token for this storage.

  ## Backup settings
  backup:
    path: /var/tmp/gitlab/backups   # Relative paths are relative to Rails.root (default: tmp/backups/)

    path: /usr/share/gitlab-shell/
    hooks_path: /usr/share/gitlab-shell/hooks/

    # File that contains the secret key for verifying access for gitlab-shell.
